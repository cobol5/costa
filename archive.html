				<p>The major feature of this version was support for multiple profiles - meaning more users could share the same installation of Costa, or that one use could have separate profiles for work, play etc.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Support for multiple profiles added, with each profile having its own settings, theme and personal desktop links</li>
					<li>Added more tips for "Tip of the Day" dialog, to help users discover more hidden (or less well-known) features of Costa</li>
					<li>Fixed bug in icon editor that resulted in a blank pixel being drawn when the left mouse button was lifted</li>
					<li>Fixed bug in icon editor that caused it to repeatly ask for confirmation before overwrite on each save, even if the icon had already been saved to that same filename</li>
					<li>Fixed bug that allowed paths to be shown belong icon captions, instead of just filenames, which cluttered the desktop with text</li>

				<p>Since version 0.9.9, not much has changed - the focus was on improving stability and fixing any bugs I could stumble upon.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Documentation finished</li>
					<li>Various bugfixes and stability improvements</li>
					<li>Parts of the code further optimized</li>
					<li>The icon editor now has an icon selector, instead of requiring a filename to open an existing icon</li>
					<li>More icons has been added using the image editor introduced in 0.9.9</li>
					<li>TextViewer no longer redraws the entire screen when scrolling, improving performance drastically</li>
					<li>The icon editor will now ask before overwriting an existing icon</li>
					<li>The icon editor now draws its grid using a pattern of grey and black, rather than just black, so that the grid is still visible when a region is painted black</li>

				<h4>Version 0.9.9</h4>
				<p>1st of May, 2011</p>

				<p>Version 0.9.9 was mostly a heavily optimized version of 0.9.8, with a few new features and an icon editor added.<p>
				<p>Since each executable file took up considerable disk space for shared functions, Costa and most of its accessories were compiled to a single EXE. This also allowed for faster execution, since everything was already in memory during runtime. By heavily optimizing the code I managed to squeeze all accessories into an EXE file less than 165 KB in size, saving about 400 KB disk space. The desktop alone from 0.9.8 was 105 KB, so that was quite decent.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>All programs combined into one EXE file for improved speed and less disk usage. The decrease in disk loading times brought vastly improved performance on slow drives and floppy disks</li>
					<li>A new icon editor was added, which - for the first time - allowed users of Costa to create their own icons</li>
					<li>COSTA.EXE replaced with COSTA.BAT - works exactly the same, but uses about 50 KB less RAM when running external programs</li>
					<li>When using the TAB-key to switch between desktop links, you could now press SHIFT+TAB to go in the opposite direction</li>
					<li>The ability to associate programs with the built-in text viewer by associating them with COSTA099.EXE was added</li>
					<li>Costa now used an environment variable, %COSTA099%, to remember the path to its files. This meant that C:\CPATH.INI was no longer required, which finally allowed Costa to run on systems without a C: drive</li>
					<li>Text-viewer for viewing small text files (tested to work with files up to 60 KB in size)</li>
					<li>Input dialog fixed, keyboard navigation now worked for the textbox</li>

				<h4>Version 0.9.8</h4>
				<p>10th of October, 2009</p>

				<p>I came to the conclusion that Costa wasn't developing at the speed I wanted it to. The reason for this was that I needed to design a complete scripting language and write a parser for it before I could actually start making programs for Costa, which meant that all my time was used on the parser. So I decided that the best for Costa was to return to single-tasking, like back in the old days when I released a new version frequently.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Once again, a complete rewrite. I had learned a lot in the past years, and this would be the final rewrite. I was now heading for a 1.0-release</li>
					<li>Desktop completed, with moveable icons, menus and more</li>
					<li>Animations. Parts of the UI are animated, which can be disabled through a configuration file if desired</li>
					<li>Configurations are stored in plain-text files to allow easy editing</li>
					<li>All controls implemented and working like a charm</li>
					<li>The user interface resembles the one from 0.8.0</li>
					<li>3 different fonts, 2 of them are even variable width fonts</li>
					<li>File associations, customizable through FILETYPE.CFG or the config util</li>
					<li>New binary icon format, with 4 times faster draws and smaller files</li>
					<li>Configuration program, with theme selector, file association editor, and a dialog with checkboxes for various settings such as animations and desktop appearance</li>
					<li>Keyboard navigation. If you unplug your mouse, you'll still be able to use Costa since everything has a hotkey, shown using an underlined letter (you don't have to press ALT, just the underlined letter). Desktop links can be used without a mouse too, using the TAB and ENTER keys.</li>
					<li>Tic Tac Toe is back, also rewritten from scratch. This time with both 1 and 2 player support</li>
					<li>Calculator, for simple calculations (+, -, * and /)</li>
					<li>Desktop links are sorted left to right, top to bottom - meaning that they have the right TAB order</li>
					<li>The mouse no longer disappears when editing a textbox</li>
					<li>Much more error handling. No matter what files are missing, Costa won't crash. It might show an error and exit, but it won't crash. Config files are automatically recreated with default values. Removed directories will also be recreated, to avoid path errors.</li>

				<p>This unreleased version was a little crazy. It's actually just 0.9.4, which can be seen if you look at the script files. All GUI code was removed, and replaced with TUI code. This made Costa a text-mode program, but still with moveable windows and such. It was kind of nice, and worked well. But it was more of an experiment than anything else. It was made available here in september 2015, for those interessed in seeing it.</p>

				<p>Costa 0.9.3 was never officaly released, but is available here for historic reasons. It had a lot of improvements over 0.9.2 that made it my personal favourite of the task-swapping editions. Sadly, the code suffered from bad planning and messy programming style. On the 19th of May, 2006 Costa 0.9.3 was cancelled.</p>
