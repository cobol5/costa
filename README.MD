# The Costa Graphical Shell
Costa is a graphical user interface (GUI), designed to run on top of the
command line as a shell.

It is designed for MS-DOS, but tested with FreeDOS and DOSBox as well. In
theory it should run on any MS-DOS compatible operating system.

The low system requirements make Costa especially useful for older machines,
which are also the machines that typically run the MS-DOS operating system.

See the included documentation for more information.
