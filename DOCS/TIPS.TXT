                          A few useful tips and tricks


 * When editing a textbox, pressing ENTER will finish the editing. However,
   you can also press ESCAPE to disregard your changes and stop the editing.
   This is useful if you regret a change you've made.

 * It is possible to type the name of any file, for example README.TXT, in
   the target field when customizing a desktop link and when using the
   "Execute" dialog. Costa will look at the FILETYPE.CFG file and see which
   program .TXT is associated with, and will pass README.TXT to that program.
   Use the configuration program to manage file associations.

 * If you don't have a mouse, use the TAB key to cycle between desktop links.
   Then press ENTER to open the link menu for the selected link. Use
   SHIFT+TAB to cycle through links in reverse order.

 * To associate an extension with the built-in text viewer, simply associate
   it with COSTA100.EXE (without any path).

 * To draw a transparent pixel in the icon editor, you don't have to choose
   the transparent color first. You can simply right click the pixel.

 * In the icon editor you can check out your icon on different background
   colors. To do so, click the preview of it (or press P on the keyboard).
